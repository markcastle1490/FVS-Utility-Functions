\usage{
avg_attr(
  attr = NULL,
  weight = NULL,
  avgtype = 1,
  dbh = NULL,
  ht = NULL,

}
\arguments{
\item{attr}{Numeric vector containing numeric attribute}

\item{dbhmin}{Numeric value corresponding to lower DBH bound to calculate attribute in.
This value is inclusive (>=).}

\item{weight:}{Numeric numeric vector containing a weighting value. This could be an
expansion factor or tree basal area, or other user defined weight. This
argument will only be used when avgtype is 2.}

\item{avgtype:}{Integer value corresponding to the type of average to calculate. This argument
will be set to 1, if input is not a value of 1 or 2.
1 = average unweighted
2 = weighted average based on weight argument}

\item{dbh:}{Optional numeric vector containing DBH values. If DBH values are provided,
then attribute will be calculated between the values specified in dbhmin and
dbhmax.}

\item{ht:}{Optional numeric vector containing total tree height values. If heights are
provided, then attribute will be calculated between the values specified in
htmin and htmax.}

\item{species:}{Optional vector containing species codes. If species are provided then
attribute will be calculated for species entered in select_species argument.
Attribute will be calculated for all species if select_species is left as
NULL.}

\item{dbhmax:}{Numeric value corresponding to upper DBH bound to calculate attribute in.
This value is exclusive (<).}

\item{hthmin}{Numeric value corresponding to lower tree height bound to calculate attribute
in. This value is inclusive (>=). This argument is only used if ht argument
is specified.}

\item{hthmax:}{Numeric value corresponding to upper tree height bound to calculate attribute
in. This value is exclusive (<). This argument is only used if ht argument
is specified.}

\item{select_spcies}{Optional vector containing species codes. This variable will be used to
select which species get included in calculation of attribute. This argument
will only be used if values are provided for species.}
}
\value{
Average or weighted average of attribute.
}
\description{
This function is used to calculate the average of an attribute. The average
can be a arithmetic average or weighted average. This average can be
calculated within custom size ranges and for select species.
