variant code, or file path to keyword.}

\item{id_type:}{Integer value pertaining to type of value specified in delete_id argument.

1 = keyword file path or file name (e.g. from KeywordFile in FVS_Cases table)

2 = fvs run title (e.g. from RunTitle in FVS_Cases table)

3 = management id (e.g. from MgmtID in FVS_Cases table)

4 = FVS variant code (e.g. from Variant in FVS_Cases table)}

\item{vacuum:}{Logical variable used to determine if output database should be vacuumed after
deleting rows from output tables. This will release unused hard drive space
left behind from row deletions.}

console.}

\description{
This function deletes desired rows in all database tables containing a CaseID
field from a specified output FVS database. The rows that are deleted are
determined from a set of CaseID values associated with any of the following
attributes: FVS run title, management ID, FVS variant code, or keyword file.
The case IDs identified for deletion are extracted from the FVS_Cases table
from the output FVS database. Some of the logic in this function was borrowed
from Nick Crookston's deleteRelatedDBRows function from fvsRunUtilities.R
file (fvsOL R package).
