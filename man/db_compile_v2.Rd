\arguments{
\item{dbIn:}{Character vector of directory paths and file names for SQLite databases to
process. Files can either be a SQLite database or zipped folder (.zip)
which contains a SQLite database(s).

NOTE: .zip files will be unzipped to a temporary folder called
xxxfvsUtildb_compileUnzipxxx in a temporary directory. The temporary folder
will be deleted after db_compile has finished writing data to output database.

Examples of valid dbIn formats:
"C:/FIA2FVS_Databases/SQLite_FIADB_AZ/FIADB_AZ.db"'
"C:/FIA2FVS_Databases/SQLite_FIADB_AZ/ FIADB_AZ.zip"}

\item{dbOut:}{Character string corresponding to SQLite database to write out to.
Examples of valid dbOut formats:
"C:/FIA2FVS_Databases/SQLite_FIADB_AZ/FVS_Data.db",}

\item{dbTables:}{Character vector of database tables to process from argument dbIn.
By default this argument contains the following values:

"FVS_STANDINIT"

"FVS_TREEINIT"

"FVS_PLOTINIT"

"FVS_STANDINIT_PLOT"

"FVS_STANDINIT_COND"

"FVS_PLOTINIT_PLOT"

"FVS_TREEINIT_PLOT"

"FVS_TREEINIT_COND"}

\item{buildGaak:}{Logical variable used to determine if FVS_GROUPADDFILESANDKEYWORDS will be
#written to dbOut. If TRUE, this table will be written to dbOut. By default,
this argument is set to TRUE.}

\item{gaakType:}{Integer value from 1 - 3 used to determine what kind of GAAK table will be
written to dbOut if buildGaak is TRUE.

1 = GAAK table with All_Stands and All_Plots grouping codes.

2 = GAAK table with All_FIA_Conditions, All_FIA_Plots, All_FIA_Subplots
grouping codes.

3 = GAAK table with All_Stands, All_Plots, All_FIA_Conditions,
All_FIA_Plots, All_FIA_Subplots grouping codes. For more information
refer to fvs_gaak function.}

\item{deleteInput:}{Logical variable used to determine if values in dbIn should be deleted after
db_compile has been called. By default this argument is set to FALSE. Be
careful with this argument. The primary purpose of this argument is to
conserve hard disk space for users who do not want the input databases
specified in dbIn.}

\item{readChunks:}{Logical variable used to determine if data from database table should be read
in chunks. In general, processing time of db_compile increases but less RAM is
used at one time in R session if this argument is TRUE.}

\item{rowsToRead:}{Integer value corresponding to number of rows to read from a database table if
readChunks is TRUE.}
}
\value{
Character string indicating that database has been created.

\description{
This function is used to read in database tables from input FVS-ready data
sets and write the database tables from each of these to a single output
SQLite database. SQLite databases (.db, .sqlite) are the only compatible input
database type that can be processed in this function. The primary purpose of
this function is to combine input FVS databases into a single database or
extract FVS database tables from a larger database such as those on the FIA
datamart.
