\arguments{
\item{keyfile:}{Character string corresponding to directory path and file name of keyword file
being created.}

\item{standid:}{Character vector of stand identification numbers.}

\item{invyear:}{Numeric vector of inventory years for each stand in standid and or standcn
arguments.}

\item{standcn:}{Optional character vector of stand control numbers. If values are not defined
for this argument, then the value from standid will be used as the stand
control number in the output keyword file.}

\item{keywords:}{Optional character vector, list, or list of character vectors containing
properly formatted FVS keywords or variables to define with event monitor
function call that will be included in keyword file for each stand.}

\item{stand_keys:}{Optional character vector containing a set of properly formatted keywords or
variables to define with event monitor function call for specific stands in
the standid argument. These keywords will be added for the given stand in the
output keyword file. If this argument is used, it should match the length of
the standid argument.}

\item{start_year:}{Common start year for simulation. If start_year and end_year are not NULL, then
function will attempt to add time keyword sequence (see time_keys function).}

\item{end_year:}{Common end year for simulation. If start_year and end_year are not NULL, then
function will attempt to add TIMEIMT and NUMCYCLE keyword sequence (see
time_keys function).}

\item{cycle_length:}{Default cycle length assumed for simulation. Only used when start_year and
end_year are not NULL.}

\item{cycle_at:}{Numeric vector containing additional reporting years (those that do not occur
on default cycle boundaries based on start_year, end_year and 'cycle_length
arguments). Only used when start_year and end_year are not NULL.}

\item{dbin:}{Character string for name of FVS input database that includes file extension
(.db, .sqlite). If this value is not NULL, the function will attempt to add a
DSNIN keyword sequence.}

\item{standinit:}{Character string corresponding to name table where stand information will be
read from. Typically this would be "FVS_standinit" of "FVS_PlotInit" but could
be "FVS_standinit_Plot", "FVS_standinit_Cond", etc. when FIA data is in use.
This is an optional argument and will only be used if dbin is not NULL.}

\item{treeinit:}{Character string corresponding to name table where tree information will be
read from. Typically this would be "FVS_treeinit" but could be
"FVS_treeinit_Plot", "FVS_treeinit_Cond", etc. when FIA data is in use. This
is an optional argument and will only be used if dbin is not NULL.}

\item{stand_type:}{Integer value that determines what stand ID will be used to read data from
dbin when dbin is not NULL.

0 = Stand_CN

1 = Stand_ID}

\item{dbout:}{Name of FVS output database that includes file extension (.db or .sqlite).
If this value is not NULL, the function will attempt to add a DSNOUT keyword
sequence.}

\item{delotab:}{Optional vector of integer values that contain any values from 1-4. If values
are provided in this argument, then DELOTAB keywords will be included in
keyword file to suppress creation of text outputs. By default this argument is
set to c(1, 2) so the stand composition table and sample tree data tables will
be suppressed in the output keyword file.}
}
\value{
None
}
\description{
This function creates a keyword file based on user defined set of keywords for
a set of stands IDs and inventory years.
