\arguments{
\item{voleq:}{Character string corresponding to NVEL equation number. i.e. "NVBM240202"}

\item{regn:}{Integer value corresponding to USFS region. A value of 1 is assumed as the
default value for this argument.}

\item{statecd:}{Integer code corresponding to state code. This code is used to set the regn
value needed for woodland species calculations.}

\item{forst:}{Character string corresponding to forest number. "01" is assumed as the
default value for this argument.}

\item{dist:}{Character string corresponding to district number. "01" is assumed as the
default value for this argument.}

\item{spcd:}{Integer value corresponding to FIA species code.}

\item{sftwd_hrdwd:}{Character value indicating whether tree is considered a hardwood or softwood
as defined by FIA. If a value is not provided then value is determined by
spcd.

H = hardwood (deciduous)

S = softwood (conifer)}

\item{dbh:}{Diameter of tree record in inches. This value could be a DBH or DRC
measurement.}

\item{ht:}{Total height of the tree record in feet.}

\item{brkht:}{Height to broken top in feet. If ht and brkht are equal, brkht will get set to
0.}

\item{stems:}{Number of woodland stems associated with the tree record.}

\item{cr:}{Live crown ratio as a percent. A value from 0 - 100 can be entered.}

\item{cull:}{Numeric value corresponding to percent cull related to rotten or missing
material. A value from 0 - 100 can be entered.}

\item{cullmstop:}{Numeric value corresponding to CULLMSTOP as defined in FIADB.TREE. A value
from 0 - 100 can be entered.}

\item{decaycd:}{Integer value corresponding to DECAYCD as defined in FIADB.TREE.}

\item{mtopp:}{Minimum top diameter inside bark for primary product.This value is interpreted
as an outside bark diameter when CTYPE = 'I' and inside bark diameter when
CTYPE = 'F'.}

\item{mtops:}{Minimum top diameter inside bark for secondary product.This value is
interpreted as an outside bark diameter when ctype = 'I' and inside bark
diameter when CTYPE = 'F'.}

\item{volbio:}{Integer value used to determine if biomass or volume will be returned.

0 = volume value will be returned (from VOL array)

1 = dry biomass value will be returned (from DRYBIO array)

2 = All 15 volumes and biomass values will be returned in a list. argument
index is ignored when volbio is 2.

3 = Log volumes will be returned as matrix.

4 = Log diameters will be returned as matrix.}

\item{index:}{Integer value used to determine what value should be returned from VOL or
DRYBIO array as specified in volbio argument. A value of 0, will have the
function return all 15 values for volume or biomass in vector.}

\item{ctype:}{Character corresponding to Cruise Type: Flag to set some special volume
criteria.

'C': Cruise volumes. Will return zero volumes if required fields
are missing.

'F': FVS volumes.Missing merchantable heights and form class variables will
be calculated if they are required.

'I': FIA. This flag to let NSVB equation to calculate merchantable volume as
the total volume from stump to merchantable height without removing trims.
The log volumes will not be calculated}

\item{live:}{Character indicator corresponding to whether tree is live or dead.

"L" = live

"D" = dead}

\item{prod:}{Character variable pertaining product code.

"01" = Sawtimber tree

"02" = Pulpwood tree

"06" = Roundwood tree.}
}
\value{
A single volume or biomass value, a numeric vector with 15 volume or biomass
values, a list with two numeric vectors containing all 15 volume and biomass
values, a matrix containing log volumes, or a matrix containing log diameters.
}
\description{
This function is used to call vollibnvb_r interface to return volume,
biomass, or carbon values for and individual tree record based on a set of
input attributes.

NOTE: In order to use this function, one must load the NVEL dll into their
R session. This can be accomplished using the load_nvel function or through
other means.
