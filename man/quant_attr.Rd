\usage{
quant_attr(
  attr = NULL,
  prob = 0.5,
  dbh = NULL,
  ht = NULL,
  species = NULL,
  dbhmin = 0,
  dbhmax = 999,
  htmin = 0,
  htmax = 999,
  select_species = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{dbhmin}{Numeric value corresponding to lower DBH bound to calculate attribute in.
This value is inclusive (>=).}

\item{select_species}{Optional vector containing species codes. This variable will be used to
select which species get included in calculation of attribute.}

\item{attr:}{Numeric vector containing numeric attribute}

\item{prob:}{Numeric value ranging from 0 - 1. This value corresponds to a percentile
value. A value of 0 would return the minimum value in attr, a value of 0.5
would return the median in attr, and a value of 1 would return the maximum
value in attr.A value of 0.5 will be assumed if invalid value is provided.}

\item{dbh:}{Optional numeric vector containing DBH values. If DBH values are provided,
then attribute will be calculated between the values specified in dbhmin and
dbhmax.}

\item{ht:}{Optional numeric vector containing total tree height values. If heights are
provided, then attribute will be calculated between the values specified in
htmin and htmax.}

\item{species:}{Optional vector containing species codes. If species are provided then
attribute will be calculated for species entered in select_species argument.
Attribute will be calculated for all species if select_species is left as
NULL.}

\item{dbhmax:}{Numeric value corresponding to upper DBH bound to calculate attribute in.
This value is exclusive (<).}

\item{hthmin}{Numeric value corresponding to lower tree height bound to calculate attribute
in. This value is inclusive (>=). This argument is only used if ht argument
is specified.}

\item{hthmax:}{Numeric value corresponding to upper tree height bound to calculate attribute
in. This value is exclusive (<). This argument is only used if ht argument
is specified.}
}
\value{
Numeric value of attribute at specific quantile.
}
\description{
This function determines the value at specific quantile for an input
attribute. This can be calculated for custom size ranges and for select
species.
