\usage{
expand_attr(
  attr = NULL,
  expf = NULL,
  dbh = NULL,
  ht = NULL,
  species = NULL,
  dbhmin = 0,
  dbhmax = 999,
  htmin = 0,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{attr}{Numeric vector containing numeric attribute}

\item{dbh}{Optional numeric vector containing DBH values. If DBH values are provided,
then attribute will be calculated between the values specified in dbhmin and
dbhmax.}

\item{dbhmin}{Numeric value corresponding to lower DBH bound to calculate attribute in.
This value is inclusive (>=).}

\item{select_species}{Optional vector containing species codes. This variable will be used to
select which species get included in calculation of attribute.}

\item{expf:}{Numeric vector containing expansion factors.}

\item{ht:}{Optional numeric vector containing total tree height values. If heights are
provided, then attribute will be calculated between the values specified in
htmin and htmax.}

\item{species:}{Optional vector containing species codes. If species are provided then
attribute will be calculated for species entered in select_species argument.
Attribute will be calculated for all species if select_species is left as
NULL.}

\item{dbhmax:}{Numeric value corresponding to upper DBH bound to calculate attribute in. This
value is exclusive (<).}

\item{hthmin}{Numeric value corresponding to lower tree height bound to calculate attribute
in. This value is inclusive (>=). This argument is only used if ht argument
is specified.}

\item{hthmax:}{Numeric value corresponding to upper tree height bound to calculate attribute
in. This value is exclusive (<). This argument is only used if ht argument
is specified.}
}
\value{
Sum of attribute expanded to a per unit area
}
\description{
This function sums and expands an input numeric attribute to a per unit area
basis using numeric vectors containing dbh, attribute of interest, and
expansion factors. The numeric attribute could be a tree-level volume,
biomass, carbon, etc.This attribute can be calculated for user defined size
ranges and for select species.
