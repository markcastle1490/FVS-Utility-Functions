db_compile(

  dbTables = NULL,

\arguments{
\item{dbIn:}{Character vector of directory paths and file names for SQLite databases to
process. Files can either be a SQLite database (.db) or zipped folder (.zip)
which contains a SQLite database(s).

NOTE: .zip files will be unzipped to a temporary folder called
xxxfvsUtildb_compileUnzipxxx in current working directory. Temporary folder will
be deleted after db_compile has finished writing data to output database.

Examples of valid dbIn formats:
"C:/FIA2FVS_Databases/SQLite_FIADB_AZ/FIADB_AZ.db"'
"C:/FIA2FVS_Databases/SQLite_FIADB_AZ/ FIADB_AZ.zip"}

\item{dbOut:}{Character string corresponding to SQLite database to write out to.
Examples of valid dbOut formats:
"C:/FIA2FVS_Databases/SQLite_FIADB_AZ/FVS_Data.db"}

\item{dbTables:}{Character vector of database tables to process from argument dbIn. If this
argument is left as NULL, then function will use all tables from the first
database specified in the dbIn argument.}

\item{buildGaak:}{Logical variable used to determine if FVS_GROUPADDFILESANDKEYWORDS will be
written to dbOut. If TRUE, this table will be written to dbOut.}

\item{gaakType:}{Integer value from 1 - 3 used to determine what kind of GAAK table will be
written to dbOut if buildGaak is TRUE.

1 = GAAK table with All_Stands and All_Plots grouping codes.

2 = GAAK table with All_FIA_Conditions, All_FIA_Plots, All_FIA_Subplots
grouping codes.

3 = GAAK table with All_Stands, All_Plots, All_FIA_Conditions,
All_FIA_Plots, All_FIA_Subplots grouping codes. For more information
refer to fvs_gaak function.}

\item{deleteInput:}{Logical variable used to determine if values in dbIn should be deleted after
db_compile has been called. The primary purpose of this argument is to
conserve hard disk space for users who do not want to retain the input
databases specified in dbIn.}

\item{keepCasing:}{Logical variable used to determine if the database table names and fields in
dbIn should retain original casing. When FALSE, the database table names and
fields in each table written to dbOut will be capitalized.}
}
\value{
Integer value of 0 invisibly returned.

\description{
This function is used to combine the contents of multiple sqlite databases
into a single sqlite database. SQLite databases (.db, .sqlite) are the only
compatible input database type that can be processed in this function. The
primary purpose of this function is to combine input FVS databases into a
single database or extract FVS database tables from a larger database such as
those on the FIA datamart.
