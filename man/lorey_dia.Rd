\usage{
lorey_dia(
  dbh = NULL,
  expf = NULL,
  ht = NULL,

  dbhmin = 0,
  dbhmax = 999,
  htmin = 0,

}
\arguments{
\item{dbh:}{Numeric vector containing DBH values.}

\item{expf:}{Numeric vector containing expansion factors.}

\item{ht:}{Optional numeric vector containing total tree height values. If heights are
provided, then attribute will be calculated between the values specified in
htmin and htmax.}

\item{species:}{Optional vector containing species codes. If species are provided then
attribute will be calculated for species entered in select_species argument.
Attribute will be calculated for all species if select_species is left as
NULL.}

\item{dbhmin:}{Numeric value corresponding to lower DBH bound to calculate attribute in.
This value is inclusive (>=).}

\item{dbhmax:}{Numeric value corresponding to upper DBH bound to calculate attribute in.
This value is exclusive (<).}

\item{htmin:}{Numeric value corresponding to lower tree height bound to calculate attribute
in. This value is inclusive (>=). This argument is only used if ht argument
is specified.}

\item{htmax:}{Numeric value corresponding to upper tree height bound to calculate attribute
in. This value is exclusive (<). This argument is only used if ht argument
is specified.}

\item{select_species:}{Optional vector containing species codes. This variable will be used to
select which species get included in calculation of attribute. If left as
NULL, attribute will be calculated using observations from across all
species.}
}
\value{
Numeric quadratic mean diameter value
}
\description{
This function calculates Lorey diameter (basal area weighted average
diameter). This attribute can be calculated for user defined size ranges and
for select species.
