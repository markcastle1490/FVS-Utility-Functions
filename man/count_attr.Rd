\usage{
count_records(
  id = NULL,
  dbh = NULL,
  ht = NULL,
  species = NULL,
  dbhmin = 0,
  dbhmax = 999,
  htmin = 0,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{id}{Vector containing tree ID values. Technically if you don't have tree ids, you
can pass any vector into this argument.}

\item{dbh}{Optional numeric vector containing DBH values.}

\item{dbhmin}{Numeric value corresponding to lower DBH bound to calculate attribute in.
This value is inclusive (>=).}

\item{select_species}{Optional vector containing species codes. This variable will be used to
select which species get included in calculation of attribute.}

\item{ht:}{Optional vector containing total tree height values. If heights are provided,
then attribute will be calculated between the values specified in htmin and
htmax.}

\item{species:}{Optional vector containing species codes. If species are provided then
attribute will be calculated for species entered in select_species argument.
Attribute will be calculated for all species if select_species is left as
NULL.}

\item{dbhmax:}{Numeric value corresponding to upper DBH bound to calculate attribute in. This
value is exclusive (<).}

\item{hthmin}{Numeric value corresponding to lower tree height bound to calculate attribute
in. This value is inclusive (>=). This argument is only used if ht argument
is specified.}

\item{hthmax:}{Numeric value corresponding to upper tree height bound to calculate attribute
in. This value is exclusive (<). This argument is only used if ht argument
is specified.}
}
\value{
Numeric count of records.
}
\description{
This function counts the number of tree records between specified DBH and HT
ranges and for select species.
